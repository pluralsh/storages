# storages

Warning!
Code in this repository works. But we've merged it directly into WAL-G https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/tree/master/pkg/storages

This was done to ensure fast path for features to WAL. Also we want to excercise WAL-G CI agains every pull request to storages. Feel free to ping [Andrey](https://github.com/x4m) if you think this decision is wrong.
